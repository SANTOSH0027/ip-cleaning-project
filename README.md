# 🐍 IP List Cleaning Script

A simple Python project to automate cleaning an IP address list.

## 💡 What It Does

✅ Reads a file of IP addresses (`text.txt`)  
✅ Reads a second file of blocked IPs (`text1.txt`)  
✅ Removes any blocked IPs from the main list  
✅ Saves the cleaned list to `clean_ips.txt`  

## 🚀 Why I Built It

As I’m knowing more about Python and cybersecurity, I wanted to practice automating small but useful tasks.

This project helped me get hands-on experience with:

- File handling in Python
- List manipulation
- Writing clean and safe loops
- Thinking about real-world security use cases

## 📝 Usage

1. Clone this repo  
2. Add your own `text.txt` (list of IPs)  
3. Add your own `text1.txt` (list of blocked IPs)
